# Diabetes prediction

Diabetes is a natural epidemic. To classify if a patient is diabetic or not makes a significant contribution to the healthcare industry.
This is my version of an already taken up project on the same.

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to 
diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several 
constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 
21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
